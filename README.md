# superlearner
superlearner in python; a meta-learner compatible with sklearn

Super Learner is a method for combining predictions from different types of models. For some information about the theory of Super Learning, see [these notes](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/laan/Class/Class_subpages/BASS_sec1_3.1.pdf), or the paper linked below.

The `superlearner` package is designed to make it easy to combine multiple Scikit-learn estimators into a Super Learner.
